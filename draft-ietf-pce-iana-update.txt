      Update to the IANA PCEP Registration Procedures and Allowing

                   draft-ietf-pce-iana-update-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the registration procedure within the IANA
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" group of
   registries.  This specification changes some of the registries with
   Standards Action to IETF Review as defined in RFC 8126.  This memo
   updates RFCs 8231, 8233, 8281, 8623, 8664, 8685, 8697, 8733, 8745,
   8779, 8780, 8800, 8934, 9050, 9059, 9168, 9357, 9504, 9603, and 9604
   for the same.

   Designating "experimental use" sub-ranges within code point
   registries is often beneficial for protocol experimentation in
   controlled environments.  Although the registries for PCEP messages,
   objects, and TLV types have sub-ranges assigned for Experimental Use,
   the registry for PCEP Error-Types and Error-values currently does
   not.  This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a specific range
   of PCEP Error-Types for Experimental Use.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry
   group was populated by several RFCs produced by the Path Computation
   Element (PCE) working group.  Most of the registries include the
   "IETF Review" [RFC8126] as registration procedures.  There are a few
   registries that use "Standards Action".  Thus the values in those
   registries can be assigned only through Standards Track or Best
   Current Practice RFCs in the IETF Stream.  This memo changes the
   policy from Standards Action to IETF Review to allow any type of RFC
   under the IETF stream to make the allocation request.

   Further, in Section 9 of [RFC5440], IANA assigns values to the PCEP
   parameters.  The allocation policy for each of these parameters
   specified in RFC 5440 is IETF Review [RFC8126].  In consideration of
   the benefits of conducting experiments with PCEP and the utility of
   experimental codepoints [RFC3692], codepoint ranges for PCEP
   messages, objects, and TLV types for Experimental Use [RFC8126] are
   designated in [RFC8356].  However, protocol experiments may also need
   to return protocol error messages indicating experiment-specific
   error cases.  It will often be the case that previously assigned
   error codes (in the PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values sub-
   registry) can be used to indicate the error cases within an
   experiment, but there may also be cases where new, experimental error
   codes are needed.  In order to run experiments, it is important that
   the codepoint values used in the experiments do not collide with
   existing codepoints or any future allocations.  This document updates
   [RFC5440] by changing the allocation policy for the registry of PCEP
   Error-Types to mark some of the codepoints as assigned for
   Experimental Use.  As stated in [RFC3692], experiments using these
   codepoints are not intended to be used in general deployments, and
   due care must be taken to ensure that two experiments using the same
   codepoints are not run in the same environment.

2.  Standards Action PCEP Registries Affected

   The following table lists the "Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) Numbers" registries whose registration policy will be changed
   from Standards Action to IETF Review.  Affected registries will list
   this document as a reference.  Where this change is applied to a
   specific range of values within the particular registry, that range
   is given in the Remarks column.

3.  Experimental Error-Types

   This document requests IANA for the designation of four PCEP Error-
   Type codepoints (252-255) for Experimental Use.

   IANA maintains a registry group called "Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" with a registry named "PCEP-ERROR Object
   Error Types and Values".  IANA is requested to change the assignment
   policy for this registry to read:

   *  Error-Types

      -  0-251 : IETF Review

      -  252-255 : Experimental Use

   *  Error-value

      -  For all IETF Review Error-Types : IETF Review

      -  For all Experimental Use Error-Types : Experimental Use

   Additionally, IANA is requested to make an entry in the table as
   follows:

     +============+==================+==================+============+
     | Error-Type |     Meaning      |   Error-value    |  Reference |
     +============+==================+==================+============+
     | 252-255    | Experimental Use |      0-255       | [this.I-D] |
     |            |                  | Experimental Use |            |
     +------------+------------------+------------------+------------+

                                  Table 2

3.1.  Advice on Experimentation

   An experiment that wishes to return experimental error codes should
   use one of the experimental Error-Type values as defined in this
   document.  The experiment should agree, between all participating
   parties, on which Error-Type to use and which Error-values to use
   within that Error-Type.  The experiment will describe what the
   meanings of those Error-Type / Error-value pairs are.  Those Error-
   Type and Error-values should not be recorded in any public
   (especially any IETF) documentation.  Textual or symbolic names for
   the Error-Types and Error-values may be used to help keep the
   documentation clear.

   If multiple experiments are taking place at the same time using the
   same implementations, care must be taken to keep the sets of Error-
   Type / Error-value distinct.

   Note that there is no scope for experimental Error-values within
   existing non-experimental Error-Types.  This reduces the complexity
   of the registry and implementations.  Experiments should place all
   experimental Error-values under the chosen experimental Error-Types.

   If, at some future time, the experiment is declared a success and
   moved to IETF work targeting publication on the Standards Track, each
   pair of Error-Type / Error-value will need to be assigned by IANA
   from the registry.  In some cases, this will involve assigning a new
   Error-Type with its subtended Error-values.  In other cases, use may
   be made of an existing Error-Type with new subtended Error-values
   being assigned.  The resulting change to code in an implementation is
   as simple as changing the numeric values of the Error-Types and
   Error-values.

3.2.  Handling of Unknown Experimentation

   A PCEP implementation that receives an experimental Error-Type in a
   PCEP message and does not recognise the Error-Type (i.e., is not part
   of the experiment) will treat the error as it would treat any other
   unknown Error-Type (such as from a new protocol extension).  An
   implementation that is notified of a PCEP error will normally close
   the PCEP session (see [RFC5440]).  In general, PCEP implementations
   are not required to take specific action based on Error-Types, but
   may log the errors for diagnostic purposes.

   An implementation that is part of an experiment may receive an
   experimental Error-Type, but not recognise the Error-value.  This
   could happen because of any of:

   *  A faulty implementation.

   *  Two implementations not being synchronised with respect to which
      Error-values to use in the experiment.

   *  More than one experiment being run at the same time.

   As with unknown Error-Types, an implementation receiving an unknown
   Error-value is not expected to do more than log the received error,
   and may close the PCEP session.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo is entirely about updating the IANA "Path Computation
   Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not change the Security Considerations for any of the
   updated RFCs.  Refer to [RFC5440] and [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps-tls13] for
   further details of the specific security measures applicable to PCEP.

   [RFC3692] asserts that the existence of experimental codepoints
   introduces no new security considerations.  However, implementations
   accepting experimental error codepoints need to take care in how they
   parse and process them in case they come, accidentally, from another
   experiment.  Further, an implementation accepting experimental
   codepoints needs to consider the security aspects of the experimental
   extensions.  [RFC6709] provides various design considerations for
   protocol extensions (including those designated as experimental).

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to John Scudder for the initial discussion behind this
   document.  Thanks to Ketan Talaulikar, Andrew Stone, and Aijun Wang
   for the review comments.

Appendix B.  Rationale for updating all registries with Standards Action

   This specification updates all the registries with the "Standards
   Action" policy.  WG considered keeping "Standards Action" for some
   registries such as flag fields with limited bits, where the space is
   tight but decided against it.  The WG's last call and IETF's last
   call process should be enough to handle the case of frivolous
   experiments taking over the few code points.  The working group could
   also create a new protocol field and registry for future use as done
   in the past (see [RFC9357]).

   Future registries in the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP)
   Numbers" registry group should prefer to use "IETF Review" over
   "Standards Action".

Appendix C.  Consideration of RFC 8356

   It is worth noting that [RFC8356] deliberately chose to make
   experimental codepoints available only in the PCEP messages, objects,
   and TLV types registries.  Appendix A of that document gives a brief
   explanation of why that decision was taken stating that:

   |  The justification for this decision is that, if an experiment
   |  finds that it wants to use a new codepoint in another PCEP sub-
   |  registry, it can implement the same function using a new
   |  experimental object or TLV instead.

   While it is true that an experimental implementation could assign an
   experimental PCEP object and designate it the "experimental errors
   object", using it to carry arbitrary contents including experimental
   error codes, such an approach would cause unnecessary divergence in
   the code.  The allowance of experimental Error-Types is a better
   approach that will more easily enable the migration of successful
   experiments onto the Standards Track.
